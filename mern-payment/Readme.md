# MERN Authentication & PayPal Subscription App

This is a full-stack web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, featuring user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The app utilizes cookies to store JWT tokens, and passwords are securely hashed and salted before storage.

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing Redux Toolkit Query for efficient data fetching and caching. The UI is styled using React Bootstrap for a responsive and modern design. The application extends its functionality to include seamless subscription management via PayPal's robust REST API.

## Introduction to PayPal MERN Web App

This application integrates PayPal for subscription-based services, allowing users to choose from various plans tailored to different needs and budgets. It leverages PayPal's APIs for subscription creation, management, and secure payment processing.

### Features

- **Subscription Plans**: Users can select from multiple subscription plans offering different features and pricing tiers.
- **PayPal Integration**: Seamless integration with PayPal's REST API for handling subscription lifecycle and payment transactions.
- **Automatic Billing**: Includes features like auto-billing and setup fees as configured through PayPal.
- **Trial Periods**: Plans may offer trial periods, enabling users to experience services before committing to paid subscriptions.

### Implementation Details

- **Frontend**: Subscription plans are displayed using React components styled with React Bootstrap. Each plan showcases its features, pricing, and a "Subscribe" button that initiates the PayPal subscription creation process.
  
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express manage server-side operations, including communication with PayPal's REST API for subscription management and MongoDB for storing subscription data.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit Query, React Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PayPal REST API
- **Payment Processing**: PayPal's REST API for secure subscription management and payment processing.
